## Refactor Using Hooks and Class Components

When you fork this repo, all of the existing Todo app's tests will be passing initially. Your task is to refactor the existing Todo app's components so that it's `Class Components` and `Lifecycle Methods` are replaced with `Functional Components` and `Hooks` and to make sure the tests still pass once you have accomplished the refactor. The existing cypress tests only confirm that the UI functions, not that `Hooks` are implemented.

The existing Todo app has the following functionality:
- Users can create a new Todo by typing text into an `input` inside a `form` and pressing enter
- Shows a list of todos with id `#todos` underneath that input
  - Use an instance of a `Todo` component for each of the Todos
- Users can delete an existing Todo by pressing an 'x' `button` next to it
- When a todo is created or deleted, a pop-up "toast" will appear to notify the user that the action has been completed.
- Whenever the count of todos changes, a pop-up "toast" will appear to notify the user that the todo count has changed.

## Tasks
Your task is to refactor **Class Components** and replace **Lifecycle Methods** with **Functional Components** and **Hooks** to fire the created/deleted/count notifications:

- Replace `componentDidMount` in `Todo` with `useEffect` to show a `"success"` toast with the text `New todo added: {todo}`
- Replace `componentWillUnmount` in `Todo` with `useEffect` to show an `"error"` toast with the text `Todo deleted: {todo}`
- Replace `componentDidUpdate` in `App` with `useEffect` to show a `"default"` toast with the text `Remaining todos: {count}`.

For the toasts notifications, this app uses the [react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify) library that has already been installed with this lab. See its `README.md` for example usage.
